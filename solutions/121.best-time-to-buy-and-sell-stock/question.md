<br>Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
<br>Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given
<br>stock on day i.
<br>If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy
<br>one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the
<br>maximum profit.
<br>Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<br>Output: 5
<br>Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit
<br>= 6-1 = 5.
<br>Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
<br>Output: 0
<br>Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
