<br>Testcase Example:  '2'
<br>Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0
<br>≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and
<br>return them as an array.
<br>Example:
<br>For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].
<br>Follow up:
<br>It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time
<br>O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a
<br>single pass?
<br>Space complexity should be O(n).
<br>Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like
<br>__builtin_popcount  in c++ or in any other language.
