{"java":"/*\r\n * [566] Reshape the Matrix\r\n *\r\n * https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/description/\r\n *\r\n * algorithms\r\n * Easy (57.68%)\r\n * Total Accepted:    45.8K\r\n * Total Submissions: 79.3K\r\n * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2],[3,4]]\\n1\\n4'\r\n *\r\n * In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can\r\n * reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original\r\n * data.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n * \r\n * You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two\r\n * positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of\r\n * the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.\r\n * \r\n * ⁠The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original\r\n * matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n * \r\n * If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal,\r\n * output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n * Example 1:\r\n * \r\n * Input: \r\n * nums = \r\n * [[1,2],\r\n * ⁠[3,4]]\r\n * r = 1, c = 4\r\n * Output: \r\n * [[1,2,3,4]]\r\n * Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix\r\n * is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n * \r\n * Example 2:\r\n * \r\n * Input: \r\n * nums = \r\n * [[1,2],\r\n * ⁠[3,4]]\r\n * r = 2, c = 4\r\n * Output: \r\n * [[1,2],\r\n * ⁠[3,4]]\r\n * Explanation:There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So\r\n * output the original matrix.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n * \r\n * Note:\r\n * \r\n * The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].\r\n * The given r and c are all positive.\r\n * \r\n * \r\n */\r\nclass Solution {\r\n    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {\r\n        if(nums.length * nums[0].length != r * c) return nums;\r\n        int[][] res = new int[r][c];\r\n        int a = 0, b = 0;\r\n        for(int i = 0; i < r; i++){\r\n            for(int j = 0; j < c; j++){\r\n                if(b == nums[0].length){\r\n                    b = 0;\r\n                    a++;\r\n                }\r\n                res[i][j] = nums[a][b++];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return res;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n"}
