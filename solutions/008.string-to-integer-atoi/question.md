<br>Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
<br>Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge,
<br>please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.
<br>Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given
<br>input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up
<br>front.
<br>Requirements for atoi:
<br>The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until
<br>the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this
<br>character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many
<br>numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
<br>The string can contain additional characters after those that form the
<br>integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of
<br>this function.
<br>If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid
<br>integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty
<br>or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
<br>If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the
<br>correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX
<br>(2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.
