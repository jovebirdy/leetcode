<br>Testcase Example:  '["NumArray","sumRange","sumRange","sumRange"]\n[[[-2,0,3,-5,2,-1]],[0,2],[2,5],[0,5]]'
<br>Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i
<br>and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
<br>Example:
<br>Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
<br>sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
<br>sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
<br>sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
<br>Note:
<br>You may assume that the array does not change.
<br>There are many calls to sumRange function.
