<br>Testcase Example:  '[3,2,4]\n6'
<br>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
<br>add up to a specific target.
<br>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
<br>not use the same element twice.
<br>Example:
<br>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
<br>Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
<br>return [0, 1].
