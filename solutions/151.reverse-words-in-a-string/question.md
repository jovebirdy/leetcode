<br>Clarification:
<br>What constitutes a word?
<br>A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
<br>Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
<br>Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing
<br>spaces.
<br>How about multiple spaces between two words?
<br>Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
