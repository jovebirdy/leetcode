<br>Testcase Example:  '"1+1i"\n"1+1i"'
<br>Given two strings representing two complex numbers.
<br>You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1
<br>according to the definition.
<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
<br>Output: "0+2i"
<br>Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert
<br>it to the form of 0+2i.
<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
<br>Output: "0+-2i"
<br>Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert
<br>it to the form of 0+-2i.
<br>Note:
<br>The input strings will not have extra blank.
<br>The input strings will be given in the form of a+bi, where the integer a and
<br>b will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And the output should be
<br>also in this form.
