<br>Testcase Example:  '[]'
<br>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
<br>house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping
<br>you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system
<br>connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
<br>houses were broken into on the same night.
<br>Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of
<br>each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight
<br>without alerting the police.
