<br>Testcase Example:  '5'
<br>Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement
<br>strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
<br>Note:
<br>The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
<br>integer.
<br>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary
<br>representation.
<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: 5
<br>Output: 2
<br>Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
<br>and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
<br>Example 2:
<br>Input: 1
<br>Output: 0
<br>Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
<br>its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
