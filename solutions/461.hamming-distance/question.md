<br>The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at
<br>which the corresponding bits are different.
<br>Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
<br>Note:
<br>0 ≤ x, y < 231.
<br>Example:
<br>Input: x = 1, y = 4
<br>Output: 2
<br>Explanation:
<br>1   (0 0 0 1)
<br>4   (0 1 0 0)
