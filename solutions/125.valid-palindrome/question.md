<br>Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only
<br>alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
<br>For example,
<br>"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
<br>"race a car" is not a palindrome.
<br>Note:
<br>Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to
<br>ask during an interview.
<br>For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
