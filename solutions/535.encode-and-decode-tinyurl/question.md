<br>Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design
<br>TinyURL.
<br>TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
<br>https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such
<br>as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.
<br>Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no
<br>restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need
<br>to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be
<br>decoded to the original URL.
