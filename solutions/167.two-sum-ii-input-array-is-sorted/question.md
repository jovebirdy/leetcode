<br>Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find
<br>two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
<br>The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
<br>add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note
<br>that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
<br>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may
<br>not use the same element twice.
<br>Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
<br>Output: index1=1, index2=2
