<br>Testcase Example:  '[1,4,3,2]'
<br>Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n
<br>pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of
<br>min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: [1,4,3,2]
<br>Output: 4
<br>Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3,
<br>4).
<br>Note:
<br>n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
<br>All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].
