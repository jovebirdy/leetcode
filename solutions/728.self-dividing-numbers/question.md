<br>A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it
<br>contains.
<br>For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 ==
<br>0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
<br>Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
<br>Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self
<br>dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
<br>Example 1:
<br>Input: 
<br>left = 1, right = 22
<br>Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
<br>Note:
<br>The boundaries of each input argument are 1 .
